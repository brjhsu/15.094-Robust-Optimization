    "First we define the \"get_metrics\" function below to easily fetch performance metrics for the rest of the optimization problems.\n",
    "In the nominal problem, the nutrient slack is equal to 1, so all nutrient requirements are indeed fulfilled. However, the food mix based on the $rations\\_pp$ variable does not appear very palatable. Essentially, there is only sugar, wheat, oil, milk, sodium, beans, and bulgur. While these ingredients clearly fulfil general macronutrient needs(protein, carbs, fats), the overall variety is very limited.\n",

    "# 2.2 Budget constrained optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "If we just add the constraint that $procurement\\_cost + total\\_cost \\leq 6000$ the problem is infeasible. Instead, we enforce the constraint $procurement\\_cost + total\\_cost \\leq 6000$ outside of the objective, then we create a slack variable in the interval $[0,1]$ which represents the fraction of the nutrients that we end up fulfilling. Lastly, we try to maximize the slack variable to push it as close to 1 as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the budget constraint case, we still see that the rations are the same in terms of which foods we feed each person. As expected, the quantity of the rations is lower in the budget constrained case, but it does not appear that we make any significant tradeoffs between any particular food. It more seems like all rations go down about the same proportion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, aside from the decrease in total cost to the budgeted 6000 dollars, we see that the other attributes of the solution are the same, the share of procurement cost, transportation cost, international cost, etc. In other words, it looks like solving the budget constrained version simply maintains all other attributes of the unconstrained problem and finds a solution for the $nutrient\\_slack$ such that the general solution remains the same, but all factors are scaled down.\n",

    "Under this setup, we are given that the uncertainty set $z$ is normally distributed. And hence with the perturbation sets $P$ we have that our uncertainty costs are also normally distributed $\\bar{a}+P'z \\sim N(\\bar{a},PP')$ and as such $$(\\bar{a}+P'z)'x \\sim N(\\bar{a}'x,xPP'x)$$\n",

    "Hence to solve this robust problem, we just need to apply the matrix multiplication $P'x$ correctly where $x$ is the vector of procurement decision variables. Then, to model the cost constraint with robustness, we pick $\\theta$ the safety parameter based on the corresponding z-score of the normal distribution. We can do this by noting that for a desired probability of $p$ we want to find $z$ such that the interval $[-z,z]$ has probability density $p$. Since the distribution is symmetric, this implies that the left tail carries probability density $(1-p)/2$. Hence we can use an inverse CDF function to get the corresponding $z$ (represented as $\\theta$. Finally, wewrite the cost constraint as:\n",

    "\n",
    "The intuition for why the uncertainty may be positively correlated is that when production is difficult for one commodity in one of the nodes, it could indicate that there is latent difficulty (e.g. bad weather conditions, broken supply chain) in producing all commodities that result in higher costs across the board. Another intuition is cost inflation. If the producer of one product decides to raise their prices, then sellers of substitute foods may also want to raise prices to increase profits (in other words, the market moves together).\n",

    "Comparing the robust solutions (With budget constrained) for various safety parameters to the previous variations of the model, we note some interesting trends. First, we see that the % split of spending on procurement vs. transportation shifts from approximately (60/40) in the nominal case to (50/50) in the robust case. This is also reflected in the increase in number of active edges as we increase the safety margin. These results are intuitive because we face less price uncertainty from international procurement sites. Hence, we would focus more on buying at international nodes and spending more on transportation. This can also be seen through the increase in the % of share of international cost as we increase the required margin of safety from 50% to 99%. Unsurprisingly, we also see that the nutrient slack goes down all the way to 0.66 in the 99% robustness case. This is intuitive because we need to prepare for all cases of price discrepancy, which means that we need to be conservative in the amount of nutrients we feed to each person to ensure they all get fed something. Likewise, the cost per person goes up as we increase the margin of safety. This is expected as due to the price uncertainty, we are paying more per person in the case of large discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose our uncertainty parameter in a practical manner, I would consider various outside factors. For example - we know that we will more so rely on international nodes in the robustness case. So I would ask myself it there are any uncertainties (e.g. potential trade wars, potential civic unrest/labor strikes in production units, potential bad weather/crop seasons coming up). If I identified a lot of potential warning signs that prices would be violative, then I would choose a larger safety parameter.\n",

    "## 2.5 Robust cost-minimizing problem \n",
    "\n",
    "We take away the cash constraint and solve again. In this case, we will require all nutrients to be satisfied (slack = 1) and change the objective back to cost minimization of the robust cost. Because we have a uncertainty parameter, we change equiality to inequality and try to minimize an epigraph variable such that \n",
    "$$ t\\geq procurement\\_cost\\_nom + theta*||v||_{2} + transportation\\_cost$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the robust - cash unconstrained case, we see that aside from changing the nutrition slack to 1, the procedure is the same as in the cash constrained version. That is, we still make the same moves in preparation of robustness (focus on purchasing from international nodes and spend more on transportation costs relative to the nominal solution), but because we have unlimited cash, we can afford to feed everyone. In other words, the behavior of the robust cash-constrained and cash unconstrained problem perform similarily. We would expect this because when we introduce the epigraph variable $t$, this is no different than adding an inequality constraint where instead we have a \"flexible budget\" that we try to minimize.\n",

    "## 2.6 Extra credit - comparison of robust sets with $||z||_{1}$ and $||Z||_{\\infty}$ norms\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we compare the two norms. We're going to keep the $P$ matrices for the interational/regional/local nodes, but instead of using $\\theta$ we will use $\\Gamma=1$ and use the $l1$ norm for the $||Z||_{\\infty}\\leq\\Gamma$ uncertainty set and the $\\infty$-norm for the $||Z||_{1}\\leq\\Gamma$ set. \n",

Another intuition is cost inflation. If the producer of one product decides to raise their prices, then sellers of substitute foods may also want to raise prices to increase profits (in other words, the market moves together)."

    "Comparing the robust solutions (With budget constrained) for various safety parameters to the previous variations of the model, we note some interesting trends. First, we see that the % split of spending on procurement vs. transportation shifts from approximately (60/40) in the nominal case to (50/50) in the robust case. This is also reflected in the increase in number of active edges as we increase the safety margin. These results are intuitive because we face less price uncertainty from international procurement sites. Hence, we would focus more on buying at international nodes and spending more on transportation. This can also be seen through the increase in the % of share of international cost as we increase the required margin of safety from 50% to 99%. Unsurprisingly, we also see that the nutrient slack goes down all the way to 0.66 in the 99% robustness case. This is intuitive because we need to prepare for all cases of price discrepancy, which means that we need to be conservative in the amount of nutrients we feed to each person to ensure they all get fed something. Likewise, the cost per person goes up as we increase the margin of safety. This is expected as due to the price uncertainty, we are paying more per person in the case of large discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose our uncertainty parameter in a practical manner, I would consider various outside factors. For example - we know that we will more so rely on international nodes in the robustness case. So I would ask myself it there are any uncertainties (e.g. potential trade wars, potential civic unrest/labor strikes in production units, potential bad weather/crop seasons coming up). If I identified a lot of potential warning signs that prices would be violative, then I would choose a larger safety parameter."
